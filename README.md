# Task Management System

## Objective
To develop a comprehensive Task Management System using Angular that demonstrates advanced concepts and best practices.

## Features
- Dashboard view with responsive design.
- Add/Edit/Delete/View tasks.
- Search and filter tasks.
- Drag-and-Drop for task status updates.
- Pagination for the task list to handle large datasets.

```

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository or extract the ZIP file.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.(Recommended Node version is v16.x.x to v18.x.x)
4. Use `ng serve` to start the development server.
5. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:4200`.


## Building the Project
- Run `ng build` to build the production version of the app.
- The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Tests
- Run `ng test` to execute unit tests via Karma.
- Test coverage reports can be viewed in the terminal or HTML output.

## Debugging
- Use browser developer tools to debug UI and inspect network requests.
- For TypeScript debugging, use the Angular CLIâ€™s `source-map` support.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Code Quality**: Adherence to Angular best practices.
- **Problem-Solving**: Logical implementation of requirements and effective state management.
- **UI/UX**: Responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Testing**: High-quality unit test coverage.
- **Creativity**: Implementation of stretch goals.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Dummy user data is used for demonstration purposes.
- State management is handled using NgRx or BehaviorSubject depending on module complexity.
